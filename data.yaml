      Hi!

      I'm a Software Development BSc student at TUT. I like electronics and fiddle a lot (too much) with Unity3D on my pastime.

      Hi!

      I'm a programmer from Finland. I like low-level fiddling with
      various things, like the Linux kernel. I have experience in C, Python and
      Java. Aside from programming, I like music in most forms. I also play
      games.

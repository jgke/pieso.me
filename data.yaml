      Hi!

      I'm a 17-year-old student from Finland, who likes anime, sports, games and
      all kinds of gadgets and hacks. I like to do things with Unity3D, C#,
      Windows Phone, Arduino and Processing, but I also like to learn, discover
      and develop new things.

      Hi!

      I'm a 19-year-old programmer from Finland. I like low-level fiddling with
      various things, like the Linux kernel. I have experience in C, Python and
      Java. Aside from programming, I like music in most forms. I also play
      games. I'm currently employed at Intel.
